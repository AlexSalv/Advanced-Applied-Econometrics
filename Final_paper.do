/*
The dataset used in this paper is an instructional dataset for econometrics from Boston College Department of Economics. This is a panel data with 12k observations across 7 years (1981-1987). We decided to keep only the observations that were present in all 7 time periods since they were more than 90% of the total, so to have a perfectly balanced data.
The aim of the paper is to analyze how the wage of individuals is affected by multiple factors, such as the years of education and the experience in different types of occupations (white collar, blue collar, services).



Panel data, which combines cross-sectional and time-series data, allows us to account for unobserved heterogeneity and capture the temporal dimension of wage changes, offering a more robust framework compared to pure cross-sectional or time-series analyses.

Regarding the panel structure, using descriptive statistics

Static model
Examine the direct impact of factors such as education and occupational experience on wage levels at a given point in time.
Control for individual-specific effects that do not change over time, providing a clear picture of cross-sectional relationships.

* Wages often exhibit a right-skewed distribution, where a small number of individuals earn very high wages compared to the majority.
* By looking at the histogram this is the case, so we decide to use lwage (log(wage)) as dependent variable, which, looking at the distribution plot, is normally distributed, helping in meeting the assumptions like normally distributed errors and heteroskedasticity, and reducing the impact of outliers.

***** Heteroskedasticity Test 

** Run OLS 
reg lwage educ expwc expbc expser exper expersq

** Test for heteroskedasticity 
estat hettest
* To test for heteroskedasticity we perform a Breuschâ€“Pagan/Cookâ€“Weisberg test, where the null hypothesis says that the errors are homoskedastic.
* Looking at the result we get a p-value of  0.5359, so we do not reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity, thus there is no need for standard error correction to control for heteroskedasticity.

** Run robust OLS
reg lwage educ expwc expbc expser exper expersq, robust
* For the sake of comparison we use robust to obtain heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors. We observe almost same values of the SE's compared with the SE's of the simple OLS. Thus, we do not have any indication of heteroskedasticity being present in the model. 


***** Unobserved Heterogeneity Test

** Fixed Effects (Within)
xtreg lwage educ expwc expbc expser exper expersq, fe
* The F-test for fixed effects is used to determine whether the fixed effects (entity-specific effects) in a panel data model are jointly significant. 
* Looking at the F-test we get a significant p-value, rejecting the null hypothesis that the firm-specific effect is equals zero for every id and indicating that the fixed effects are significant and that there is unobserved heterogeneity. 
* Thus, pooled OLS is not a suitable model to fit our data. 


***** Violation of Strict Exogeneity Test

 * Wooldrige strict exogeneity test

* To test for strict exogeneity in a fixed effects model using the approach suggested by Wooldridge, we include leads and lags of the independent variables in the regression and test their joint significance.
* Looking at the output we can see that the leads of expwc and expbc are significant and, about the F-test, we get a significant p-value, rejecting the null hypothesis and indicating that the lagged and future values of the explanatory variables are jointly significant. 
* This suggests that the explanatory variables are correlated with the error term, violating the strict exogeneity assumption.


**********************************************************************************************
* Static Models
**********************************************************************************************

* Our main goal its to see which one fits better (random vs fixed) but we will first still run a pooled ols and a between estimator.

** POOLED OLS
reg lwage educ expwc expbc expser exper expersq
* Running the pooled OLS we see that all variables are significant and the R-squared is 0.23.
* But the pooled OLS is not a suitable model since the panel structure of our data is ignored and the data are treated as if they had a cross-section structure. The pooled OLS does not account for the unobserved heterogeneity within our panels.

** BETWEEN ESTIMATOR
xtreg lwage educ expwc expbc expser exper expersq, be
* The between estimator is also not suitable model as it only accounts for the between countries variation, ignoring for the existence of firm-specific effect.

** FIXED EFFECTS (WITHIN) MODEL

* 

** FIRST DIFFERENCES MODEL
reg D.lwage D.educ D.expwc D.expbc D.expser D.exper D.expersq year, nocons

* We obtain 1 significant variable and using differences we control for the unobserved heterogeneity, but the violation of strict exogeneity is still not addressed. With the robust option we get similar SE's indicating no heteroskedasticity issue. 

** RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL 
xtreg lwage educ expwc expbc expser exper expersq year, re
* The majority (56.96%) of the variability in the outcome variable can be explained by group-level characteristics.
* This suggests that there is significant variation between groups, justifying the use of a random effects model to account for these differences.
* In the random effect model we assume that our regressors are not correlated with the firm-specific effect. We observe that the variance of the firm-specific effect explains only small fraction of the overall variance. That is an indicator that the unobserved heterogeneity is not very important in our model.
* Large fraction of the variance of the overall error term is due to the variance of the individual effect. Indicates that individual heterogeneity is important.



* Hausman Test (Compare Random vs. Fixed Effets Model)
hausman fixed .
* Given the low p-value, lower than the  conventional significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a systematic difference between the fixed and random effects models, suggesting that the fixed effects model is more appropriate for our data.
